### Learning Objectives

* Common cloud computing services
* Benefits of cloud computing
* Cloud deployment model

### What is cloud computing?

It's a resource rental based on a pay per use approach, abstracting the hardware from the users.

### Cloud Computing Services

#### Compute Power

It is the processing capability offered by cloud-based servers. Depending on our needs, we can chose among three different options:

* **Virtual Machines (VM)**: You are provided the hardware and the OS, but have to control and maintain the rest of the software. This VM will run on a physical server based on a datacenter and overall resources will be shared with other VMs in an isolated and secure fashion.

* **Containers**: Such as Docker, offer an independent, consistent and isolated execution environment for applications. They do not require any OS - as they just contain the minimum dependencies to run the app - they are easy and fast to spin up, move to a different machine and scale.

* **Serverless Computing**: Is the ability to run an application without creating, configuring nor maintaining a server. By breaking the whole application into smaller pieces, we can define a workflow and a set of triggers to execute the different parts of the application.

As per **pricing**, with VMs and Containers, we pay for as long the server is up, eventhough the application is idle. With Serverless Computing though, you only pay for the processing time of each function.

#### Storage

If you either need to store a file or use a database, cloud providers offer the possibility to scale the storage as per your needs.

#### Summary

As requirements vary among all the processes and services business needs to offer, cloud computing is a **flexible** and **cost-efficient** solution to both small or big companies.

### Benefits of Cloud Computing

* **Cost-Effective**: with a pay-as-you-go model you don't need to make huge upfronts investments to start offering your services. Moreover, you don't need to manage any kind of infrastructure, freeing people to focus on other tasks.

* **Scalable**: It's easy to increase / decrease the resources used either manually or automatically.
    * *Vertical Scaling* or *scaling up* can be used to increase the power of an existing machine.
    * *Horizontal Scaling* or *scaling out* adds more servers to function together as a unit.

* **Elastic**: Can automatically adapt to workload changes by adding or removing resources.

* **Current**: By removing the need of managing hardware and other IT tasks, you can focus on just building and deploying your apps.

* **Reliable**: As it offers backups, disaster recovery and data replication services to make sure that your data is always safe. If on top you follow redudancy on your architectures you can avoid single points of failure.

* **Global**: With datacenters all over the globe, you can have presence close to your customers and reduce response time.

* **Secure**: Offering policies, technologies and controls.

### Compliance terms and requirements

Cloud providers should also help when complying with regulations and standards such as GDPR.

### Economies of Scale

The ability to do things at a lower cost per unit when operating at a larger scale.

### Capital expenditure (CapEx) versus operational expenditure (OpEx)

* **Capital Expenditure (CapEx)**: Spending of money on physical infrastructure up front, and then deducting that expense from your tax bill over time. This is the example of on-premise servers, where one needs to pay for server, storage, network, backup, disaster recovery and general infrastructure costs for both software and hardware plus the technical personnel.

* **Operational Expenditure (OpEx)**: Spending money on services or products now and being billed for them now. With cloud computing we can access to more customized features as we're not sharing the same framework for everyone. Charges are scalable based on usage rather than having a fixed capacity and the billing can directly by focused to a user or organization level.

![img](./assets/principles-of-cloud-computing/capexvsopex.png)

### Cloud deployment models

A cloud deployment model defines where the data is stored and how customers interact with it.

* **Public Cloud**: No local hardware - everything runs on the cloud provider. It implies the following **advantadges**:
    * Scalability and agility, as you just rent more hardware when needing it.
    * Pay-as-you-go pricing: no CapEx.
    * No need for hardware maintenance.
    * Minimal technical knowledge to set up and use.

    However, there also are some **disadvantages**:
    * Maybe you are not able to manage the hardware as you'd want.
    * It's possible that some security requirements, policies or standards that cannot be met.
    * Unique business requirements - such as maintaining a legacy application - might be hard to meet.

* **Private Cloud**: You set up the whole datacenter, access policies and resources in the organization. This has some **advantages**:
    * You can configure it so that it's possible to maintain any legacy app.
    * Full control (and responsability) over security.
    * Easier to meet security, policy and standards.

    The **disadvantages** would be:
    * Initial CapEx costs.
    * Limited agility.
    * High IT skills.

* **Hybrid Cloud**: Combination of Public and Private clouds, which brings both worlds advantages which may be benefitial for some applications or configurations but also can end up being more expensive and hard to manage.

### Types of Cloud Services

* **IaaS**: Most flexible category, giving full control on the hardware that runs the app.
    > **Shared repsonsibility model**: Ensuring that a service is running is a shared responsibility between the cloud provider (in charge of the infrastructure) and the customer (who needs to set up the proper configurations).
    This is the usual scenario when migrating workloads - as you can mimic on-premise setup, testing and deployment for new apps and for storage, backup and recovery.

* **PaaS**: Provides an environment for building, testing and deploying software applications, where one does not need to care about the underlying infrastructure. It is useful as it brings a framework that developers can work upon and also for analytics or BI tasks.

* **SaaS**: Software hosted and managed for the customer, who acts as end user.

    <p>
    Elasticity: Elasticity, Agility and Economies of scale are the correct answers, and would be seen as benefits that you can gain from using cloud services.
    </p>
    </details>


2. Suppose you have two types of applications: legacy applications that require specialized mainframe hardware and newer applications that can run on commodity hardware. Which cloud deployment model would be best for you?


* Public cloud
* Private cloud
* Hybrid cloud

    <details>
    <summary> 
    Answer
    </summary>
    <p>
    Hybrid cloud: A hybrid cloud is a public and private cloud combined. You can run your new applications on commodity hardware you rent from the public cloud and maintain your specialized mainframe hardware on-premises.
    </p>
    </details>

3. You're developing an application and want to focus on building, testing, and deploying. You don't want to worry about managing the underlying hardware or software. Which cloud service type is best for you?

* Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
* Platform as a Service (PaaS)
* Software as a Service (SaaS)


    <details>
    <summary> 
    Answer
    </summary>
    <p>
    Platform as a Service (PaaS): Platform as a Service is the best choice here because the PaaS services handle the IT management tasks for you, so you can focus on writing code.
    </p>

## Core Cloud Services - Azure architecture and service guarantees

<details>
<summary> 
Show content
</summary>
<p>

### Learning Objectives

* Physical infrastructure of Azure.
* Understand the service level agreements provided by Azure.
* Learn how to provide your own service level agreement for your apps.

### Datacenters and Regions

Cloud providers are built upon datacenters around the globe, where the physical hardware is located.

**Regions** are geographical areas on the planet containing +1 datacenter. This partition into regions gives flexibility to provide services which are close - and thus ensure lower latency - to the user.

### Geographies

Azure divides the world into **geographies** that are defined by geopolitical boundaries. Each geography preserve data residency and compliance needs required by those countries. Moreover, they are fault-tolerant to withstand complete region failure. We have the following geographies:

* Americas
* Europe
* Asia Pacific
* Middle East and Africa

Each region belongs to a single geography and has specific service availability, compliance, and data residency/sovereignty rules applied to it

### Availability Zones

To avoid single points of failure, cloud providers can help us create highly available applications through **Availability Zones**, which are separate datancenters within a region isolated from each other. If one zone goes down, the others keep working. The idea is that we can locate the resources in a zone and replicate in another.

There are two types of services that support AZs:
* Zonal Services: where the resource is pinned to a specific zone (e.g., a VM)
* Zone-redundant Services: where the platform automatically replicates services accross zones (e.g., zone-redundant storage or SQL databases)

### Region Pairs

Availability zones are created using 1+ datacenters, and there is a minimum of three zones within a single region. To ensure that services can still be provided even if two datacenters go down, Azure created Region Pairs.

Region Pairs are two region in the same geography but at least 300 miles away, which helps replicating resources accross the same geography and ensuring availabilty even in case of disaster. They are used to provide reliable services and data redudancy (geo-redundant).

### Service-Level Agreements

Formal documents called Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) capture the specific terms that define the performance standards that apply to Azure. These documents are specific for individual services and define what happens if a products fails to perform.

There are three key characteristics of SLAs:

* **Performance Targets**: such as uptime guarantees or connectivity rates.
* **Uptime and Connectivity Guarantees**: which usually specify from 99.9% performance target commitment to 99.999%.
* **Service Credits**: describing how Microsoft will respond if a service fails to perform its governing SLA's specification.

### Compose SLAs accross services

Combining SLAs from different services results in a *Composite SLA*. We can calculate this with probability calculus.

For example having a Web App (99.95%) that redirects trafic to either a DB (99.99%) or a Queue (99.9%) gives us:

* If the probability that both DB and queue are up is `1.0 − (0.0001 × 0.001) = 99.99999%`
* Then, the composite SLA ends up as

```bash
99.95 × 99.99999 = ~99.95%
```

### Improve your app reliability

*Application SLA* is the creation of your own SLA based on the workloads and services. We need to know our business requirements to provide a solution that best suits an overall SLA considering all components.

Although rare, we also need to plan for entire service disruption. Here we have important aspects such as **Resiliency**, the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. High availability and disaster recovery are two crucial components of resiliency. Howeher, the higher availability we want our application to be, the more expensive it will get as it will require more resources. This will also make it more complex in the overall architecture.


### Knowledge Check

## Create an Azure Account

<details>
<summary> 
Show content
</summary>
<p>


### Accounts and subscriptions

An **Azure account** is an identity in either Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), or a directory that is trusted by Azure AD, such as a work or school organization. It holds information such as:

* Name, email, and contact preferences
* Billing information such as a credit card

You use an Azure account to sign in to the Azure website and administer or deploy services. Every Azure account is associated with one or more subscriptions.

An **Azure subscription** is a logical container used to provision resources in Azure and is associated with Azure AD.

There are four different subcription types:

* Free
* Pay-As-You-Go
* Enterprise Agreement
* Student

### When to use multiple Azure subscriptions

Sometimes it is useful to separate resources at a subcription level, as **billing** and **access control** happen at the subscription. We could use this to separate DEV and PROD environments for billing and security reasons or even to isolate some resources for compliance.

Also, note that one could also transfer a subscription from one billing account to another.

### Authenticate access with Azure Active Directory

Azure AD is a modern identity provider that supports multiple authentication protocols. It is partitioned into separate **tenants**, which are dedicated and isolated instances of the Azure Active Directory service, owned and managed by an organization. A tenant may have multiple subscriptions (in a trust relationship), but a subscription only belongs to one tenant.

![./assets/azure-account/4-azure-ad-tenant.png]

Notice that each Azure AD tenant has an account owner. This is the original Azure account that is responsible for billing. You can add additional users to the tenant, and even invite guests from other Azure AD tenants to access resources in subscriptions.

### Knowledge Check

1. Which of the following defines an Azure subscription correctly?

* Using Azure does not require a subscription
* All Azure subscriptions are always free
* An Azure subscription is a logical unit of Azure services that is linked to an Azure account

<summary> 
Show content
</summary>
<p>

### Azure management options

There is a broad selection of tools that can be used to configure and manage Azure.


* **Azure portal** for interacting with Azure via a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It uses a **blades model** for navigation, where a blade is a slide-out panel containing the UI for a single level in a navigation sequence. The initial dashboard can be configured with a tile system to show the resources or metrics that the user is interested in the most. Dashboards can be created, cloned or deleted and configured using the *dashboard.json* file.
* **Azure PowerShell** and Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) for command line and automation-based interactions with Azure.
* **Azure Cloud Shell** for a web-based command-line interface.
* **Azure mobile app** for monitoring and managing your resources from your mobile device.

Moreover, it is good to know that one can use preview resources (by searching for "preview") and get notified about General Availability (GA) releases in the "What's new" link.

## Core Cloud Services - Azure compute options

<details>
<summary> 
Show content
</summary>
<p>

### Learning Objectives

* Identify compute options in Azure.
* Select compute options that are appropriate for your business.

### Essential Azure compute concepts

Azure compute is an on-demand computing service for running cloud-based applications in the form of:

* **Virtual Machines**: software emulations of physical computers. They include a virtual processor, memory, storage and networking resources. They need to run on an OS.
* **Containers**: virtualization environment for running applications. They do not need any OS, instead they just include the minimum necessary dependencies to run the application and use the existing host OS running the container.
* **App Service**: PaaS offering in Azure designes to host web-oriented applications.
* **Serverless Computing**: is a cloud-hosted execution environment that runs your code but abstracts the underlying hosting environment.

### Explore Azure Virtual Machines

They are a useful choice when we need
* Total control over the operating system (OS)
* The ability to run custom software, or
* To use custom hosting configurations

Some use examples could be during testing and development, when running applications in the cloud without the need of creating the infrastructure, when extending your datacenter to the cloud or during disaster recovery to being able to run business critical applications.

Moreover, when migrating to the cloud, you could use a full IaaS approach to "lift and shift" your applications, copying your physical server configurations.

#### Scaling VMs

Grouping VMs together can bring the benefits of high availability, scalability and redundancy:
* **Availability sets**: logical grouping of two or more VMs to keep applications up during maintenance. This could mean that some patches or upgrades needed to be done on the machine (planned maintenance) or due to hardware failure in the datacenter (unplanned maintenance). The group of VMs that share common hardware are in the same *fault domain* - rack of servers.

    With an availability set you get up to three fault domains that each have a server rack with dedicated power and network resources and five logical update domains, which indicate the group of VMs that are being rebooted / patched at the same time.

    ![img](./assets/azure-compute-options/availability-sets.png)

* **Scale sets**: let you create and manage a group of identical, load balanced VMs in order to provide high availability apps and increase / decrease the number of VMs depending on demand.

* **Azure Batch**: enables large-scale job scheduling and compute management with the ability to scale to tens, hundreds or thousands of VMs. Batch starts a pool of VMs, installs applications and staging data, runs the jobs, identifies failures and requeues works, scales down the pool as work completes.

### Explore Containers in Azure

Azure supports Docker containers. There are several ways to manage containers in Azure:

* **Azure Container Instances (ACI)**: PaaS offering that allows to upload the containers and execute them directly with automatic elastic scale.
* **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: Complete orchestration service (automating, managing and interacting) for containers with distributes architectures with multiple containers.

Containers are often used to create solutions using a **microservice architecture**. This architecture is where you break solutions into smaller, independent pieces, which allows to scale and upgrade the differents parts independently.

### Explore Azure App Service

PaaS service that allows you to focus on the website and API logic while Azure handles the infrastructure to run and scale your web applications. You pay for the resources used by processing depending on the App Service Plan chosen, which determines how much hardware is devoted to your host.

There are different types of web apps:

* **Web Apps**: which supports web app hosting.
* **API Apps**: you can build REAS-based Web APIs with Swagger support and the ability to package and publish your API in the Azure Marketplace.
* **Web Jobs**: allow you to run a program or scripts in the same context as a web app,API app or mobile app. They can be scheduled or run by a trigger.
* **Mobile app back-ends**: lets one quickly build the backend for iOS or Android apps. You can store mobile app data in cloud DBs, authenticate customers, send push notifications and execute custom backend logic.

### Explore Serverless computing in Azure

Serverless computing encompasses three ideas:
* **Abstraction of servers**: where you simply deploy your code which then runs with high availability.
* **Event-driven scale**: Which is an excellent fit for workloads that respond to events. The platform automatically scales. Events can be defined by a variety of triggers.
* **Micro-billing**: Where you pay only for the time that your code is running.

Azure has two implementations of serverless compute:

* **Azure Functions**: which can execute code in almost any modern language. Furthermore, Azure Functions can be either stateless (the default) where they behave as if they're restarted every time they respond to an event), or stateful (called "Durable Functions") where a context is passed through the function to track prior activity.
* **Azure Logic Apps**: which execute workflows designed to automate business scenarios based on an event. They can be defined via UI or JSON files. While Azure Functions can run locally, Logic Apps only run in the cloud.

### Kwnowledge Check


1. Suppose you have an existing application running locally on your own server. You need additional capacity but prefer to move to Azure instead of buying upgraded on-premises hardware. Which compute option would likely give you the quickest route to getting your application running in Azure?

* Serverless computing
* Containers
* Virtual machines


    <details>
    <summary> 
    Answer
    </summary>
    <p>
    You have full control over the VM setup, so you can configure it to match your on-premises server. This control will allow your existing application to run on the Azure VM with little or no change.
    </p>
    </details>

2. Imagine that you work on a photo-sharing application that runs on millions of mobile devices. Demand is unpredictable because you see a spike in usage whenever a locally or nationally significant event occurs. Which Azure compute resource is the best match for this workload?

* Serverless computing
* Containers
* Virtual machines

    <details>
    <summary> 
    Answer
    </summary>
    <p>
    The photo-sharing app is event driven and needs to handle unpredictable demand. Serverless computing is a good fit for this situation because it is event-based and can scale instantly to process spikes in traffic. It should also be a cost-effective choice because you will pay for compute time only when processing user data.
    </p>
    </details>


3. The compute options give you different levels of control over the configuration of the environment in which your application runs. Which of the following lists the compute options in order from "most control" to "least control"?

* Serverless computing, containers, virtual machines
* Containers, serverless computing, virtual machines
* Virtual machines, containers, serverless computing


    <details>
    <summary> 
    Answer
    </summary>
    <p>
    Virtual machines give you full control over the environment. Containers give you limited control. Serverless computing does not allow you to do any infrastructure configuration.

* **Data storage in virtual disks**: with up to 8TB capacity per disk.
* **Storage Tiers**: to prioritize access to data based on frequently used vs. rarely used information.

### Types of Data

* **Structured data**: data that adhers to a schema so all of it has the same fields or properties. Also known as relational data.
* **Semi-structured data**: which does not neatly fit into tables, rows and columns. Uses *keys* to organize and provide a hierarchy. Also known as non-relational or NoSQL data.
* **Unstructured data**: No structure means no restrictions. For example, a blob can hold a PDF, JPG, JSON, video...

### How Azure data storage can meet your business storage needs

* **Azure SQL**: As a Database as a Service (DaaS), it gives the latest stable SQL server engine in a high performance, reliable, fully managed and secure way.
* **Azure Cosmos DB**: Distributed database service which supports schema-less data. This means that it supports applications with changing data.
* **Azure Blob Storage**: It is unstructured, so no restrictions applied. Blobs are scalable and it's easy to rowk with blobs with applications. They can manage thousands of simultaneous uploads and massive amounts of data.
* **Azure Data Lake Storage**: Large repository hosting both structured and unstructured data which allows to perform analytics on the data. Combines the scalability and cost benefits of object storage with the reliability and performance of the Big Data file system capabilities.
* **Azure Files**: Offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. Machines can mount these to have access to the data.
* **Azure Queue**: Service for storing large numbers of message. It also can be used to help build flexible applications and separate functions for better durability across large workloads and provides asynchronous message queueing for communication between application components.
* **Disk Storage**: Disk storage provides disks for virtual machines, applications, and other services to access and use as they need, similar to how they would in on-premises scenarios.
* **Storage Tiers**: Azure offers three storage tiers for blob object storage:
    * Hot storage tier: optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently.
    * Cool storage tier: optimized for data that are infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days.
    * Archive storage tier: for data that are rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days with flexible latency requirements.
* **Encryption and replication**: Azure provides security and high availability to your data through encryption and replication features:
    * Encryption for storage services: We can choose between SSE (Azure Storage Service Encryption) which encrypts data before writing and decrypts when reading transparently to the user or Client-side encryption, where the data is already encrypted by the client libraries.
    * Replication for storage availability: ensuring that data is durable and available.

### Comparison between Azure data storage and on-premises storage

Storing data in the cloud gives the following benefits vs. on prem solutions:

* **Cost effectiveness**: as we don't need an upfront expense and just pay-as-you-go.
* **Reliability**: Azure data storage provides data backup, load balancing, disaster recovery, and data replication as services to ensure data safety and high availability without as much investment as in on premise.
* **Multiple storage** types depending on your needs.
* The **agility** to change the technologies used.

### Learning Objectives

* How an Azure virtual network provides secure network communication among resources such as virtual machines and other networks
* What high availability and resiliency mean and how Azure Load Balancer can increase resiliency within a single geographic region
* What latency is and how Traffic Manager helps reduce network latency and provides resiliency across geographic locations

### Deploy your site to Azure

#### Using an N-tier architecture

This approach divides an application into two or more logial tiers. A higher tier can access services from a lower tier, but a lower tier should never access a higher tier. It allows for reusability of the different pieces and simplifies maintenance.

A *three-tier* architecture is often used in web applications:

![img](./assets/azure-networking/three-tier.png)

This also allows for fine-grained securization of the different pieces with inbound rules.

#### Your e-commerce site running on Azure

Let's break down some definitions:

* **Region**: one or more Azure datacenters within a specific geographic location.
* **Virtual Network**: logically isolated network on Azure, allowing resources to securely communicate with each other, to the internet and on-premise networks. A virtual network is scoped to a single region, but multiple networks from different regions can be connected together by peering.
* **Subnets** are an internal logical organization of a virtual network so that you can organize and secure your resources in discrete sections.
* **Network Security Group** or NSG allows or denies inbound network traffic to your Azure resources. It can be seen as a cloud-level firewall.


### Scale with Azure Load Balancer

* **Availability** refers to how long your service is up and running without interruption. **High Availability** refers to a service that is up and running for a long period of time.
* **Resiliency** refers to a system's ability to stay operational during abnormal conditions such as natural disasters, maintenance (planned or unplanned), spikes in traffic and malicious threads.
* **Load Balancer** distributes traffic evenly among each system in a pool in order to achieve high availability and resiliency.
* **Azure Application Gateway** is a load balancer designed for web applications. It uses Load Balancer at the transport level (TCP) and applies sophisticated URL-based routing rules to support several advanced scenarios. The image below shows an application layer (OSI layer 7) load balancing, as it understands HTTP messages.

![img](./assets/azure-networking/appgateway.png)

    Some benefits of using an App Gateway over a LB are:
    * Cookie affinity, when you want to keep a user session on the same backend server.
    * SSL termination: pass uncrypted traffic to the backend. It also support full end-to-end encryption if you need it.
    * Web application firewall, as it supports a sophisticated firewall (WAF).
    * URL rule-based routes: allows you to route traffic based on URL patterns, source IP address and port to destination IP address and port. This is helpful when setting up a content delivery network.
    * Rewrite HTTP headers to add or remove information of outbound HTTP headers.

* A **content delivery network** (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users. It is useful to get content to users in their local region to minimize latency.

* **DNS** or Domain Name System is a way to map user-friendly names to their IP addresses.

### Reduce latency with Azure Traffic Manager

**Latency** is the time it takes for data to travel over the network (in ms). Contrary, **bandwidth** refers to the amount of data that can fir on the connection. One of the biggest factors affecting latency is distance.

Thus, one way to reduce latency is to provide different copies of a Web App in different regions and then use **Azure Traffic Manager** to route users to the closest endpoint. It uses the DNS server that's closer to the user.

![img](./assets/azure-networking/traffic-manager.png)

You could even connect Traffic Manager to an existing on-premise network.


### Knowledge Check

## Security, responsibility and trust in Azure 

<details>
<summary> 
Show content
</summary>
<p>

### Learning Objectives


* Security responsibility is shared with Azure
* Identity management provides protection, even outside your network
* Encryption capabilities built into Azure can protect your data
* To protect your network and virtual networks

### Cloud security is a shared responsibility

* In IaaS, you are responsible of patching and securing the OS, software and network.
* In PaaS, you need to secure your application but not the infrastructure.
* With SaaS, almost everything is outsourced.

However, you are always responsible for __data, endpoints, accounts and access management__.

#### A layered approach to security

Defense in depth is a strategy that employs a series of mechanisms to slow the advance of an attack aimed at acquiring unauthorized access to information. After a layer is breached, the next is already in place to prevent further exposure. This way there is not just a single layer of protection.

![img](./assets/azure-security/defense_in_depth_layers_small.png)

* **Data**: Attackers usually are after data. It's the user's responsibility to control data access and security.
* **Application**: Development teams must ensure app security and avoid vulnerabilities.
* **Compute**: Secure access to VMs and implement endpoint protection.
* **Networking**: Secure the resources communication.
* **Perimeter**: Protect from network-based attacks such as DDoS. Use firewalls to identify and alert on malicious attacks.
* **Identify and access**: ensure identities are secure and grant access only to what is needed.
* **Physical Security**: Physical buildings and access control.

### Get tips from Azure Security Center

Is a monitoring service that provides threat protection across all of your services both in Azure, and on-premises, which continuously monitors services and resources and provides security recommendations. Has both free and standard tiers.

#### Usage Scenarios

1. You can use Security Center for incident response to detect (first indication of event investigation), asses (initial analysis to obtain information about the suspicious activity) and diagnose (to conduct a technical investigation and identify containment, mitigation and workaround strategies).
1. Use Security Center recommendations to enhance security by configuring security policies, which define a set og controls to specified subscriptions or resource groups.

### Identity and access

* **Authentication** is the process of establishing the identity of a person or service looking to access a resource.
* **Authorization** is the process of establishing what level of access an authenticated person or service has.

#### What is Azure Active Directory?

Azure AD is a cloud-based identity service. It provides services such as

* **Authentication** to identify access to applications and resources.
* **Single-Sign-On** (SSO), which enables users to remember only one ID and password accross multiple applications.
* **Application Management**, where you can manage your cloud and on-premise apps using Azure AD Application Proxy.
* **Business to business (B2B) Identity services**: Manage your guest users and external partners while maintaining control over your own corporate data Business-to-Customer (B2C) identity services.
* **Device Management**. Manage how your cloud or on-premises devices access your corporate data.

#### Multi-factor authentication

MFA provides addictional security for your identities by requiring two or more elements for full authentication. These elements fall into three categories:
* Something you know - password or the answer to a security question.
* Something you posses - mobile app that receives a notification or token.
* Something you are - biometric property.

#### Providing identities to services

Usually, and against best practices, services credentials are embedded into not securized configuration files, which is a risk to exposure. Azure AD addresses this problem through two methods: service principals and managed identities for Azure services.

* An **Identity** is just a thing that can be authenticated, such as users, applications or servers.
* A **Principal** is an identity acting with certain roles or claims (such as `sudo`).
* A **Service Principal** is an identity that is used by a service or applications. Like other identities, it can be assigned roles.

Creating Service Principals can be tedious. That's why Managed identites for Azure services are much easier and will do most of the work for you. A managed identity can be instantly created for any service supporting it, which automatically creates an account on AD and the infrastructure will automatically take care of authenticating the service and managing the account.

#### Role-based access control

Roles are sets of permissions, like "Read-only" or "Contributor", that users can be granted to access an Azure service instance. Roles can be assigned at different levels and can be inherited:

Management Group > Subcription > Resource Group > Resource

#### Privileged Identity Management

It is an additional paid-on offering that provides oversight of role assignments, self-service and just-in-time role activiation and Azure AD and resources access reviews.

### Encryption

Encryption is the process of making data unreadable and unusable to unauthorized viewers.

* **Symmetric Encryption** uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data.
* **Asymmetric Encryption** uses a public key and private key pair, for example in SSH connections.

Encryption is approached in two ways:

* **Encryption at rest**: stored data is encrypted (in a disk or db), which makes the data unreadable without the keys and secrets to decrypt it.
* **Encryption in transit**, such as HTTPS, ensures that data is safe while traveling from one location to another. This gives protection to outside observers.

#### Encryption on Azure

* **Azure Storage Service Encryption** encrypts data at rest.
* **Azure Disk Encryption** helps encrypt VMs disks.
* **Transparent data encryption (TDE)** protects data in Azure SQL databases and Data Warehouses. It uses a symmetric encryption key.

Moreover, we need to makesure that keys themselves are secure. For this, Azure bring **Azure Key Vault**, which helps to manage both keys and secrets which are accessible via API. Also, it makes it easier to manage certificates (SSL/TSL) and sotre secrets backed by hardware security models (HSMs).

Some of the benefits of Azure KV are that you are centralizing application secrets which helps to control their distribution; secrets and keys are secure and you can monitor access and use; simplified administration of application secrets and is a service tightly integrated with other Azure services.

### Overview of Azure certificates

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the basis for encryption of website data in transit. These certificates, though, have a lifecycle and require administration.

#### Types of certificates

* **Service Certificates** used for cloud services and enable secure communication and from the service. They can be managed separately from the service itself.
* **Management Certificates** are used for authenticating with the management API. They can be used to automate configuration and deployment of various Azure services. These are not directly related to any cloud service.

All of these certificates can be stored in Azure Key Vault as any other secret.

### Protect your network

A common theme is an emphasis of a layered approach to security.

A **firewall** is a service that grants server access based on the originating IP of the request. To provide inbound protection at the perimeter one can use:
* **Azure Firewall** which protects Azure Virtual Network resources.
* **Azure Application Gateway** which is a Load Balancer with a Web Application Firewall included. This protects from common, known vulnerabilities in websites. It is specifically designed to protect HTTP traffic.
* **Network virtual appliances (NVAs)** are ideal for non-HTTP services. Similar to hardware firewall appliances.

#### Stopping Distributed Denial of Service (DDos) attacks

These attacks attemp to overwhelm a network resources by sending requests. Azure uses the scale and elasticity of Microsoft's global network to mitigate DDoS attacks.

#### Controlling the traffic inside your virtual network

Network Security Groups allow you to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network. They can contain multiple inbound and outbound rules to filter traffic. You can even totally remove public internet access to some resources.

VPN (Virtual Private Network) can be used to integrate on-premises network with Azure networks with secure communication. One could even use Azure **ExpressRoute** to connect cloud services over a private circuit instead of the public internet.

### Protect your shared documents

Microsoft Azure Information Protection (sometimes referred to as AIP) is a cloud-based solution that helps organizations classify and optionally protect documents and emails by applying labels.

### Azure Advanced Threat Protection

Azure Advanced Threat Protection (Azure ATP) is a cloud-based security solution that identifies, detects, and helps you investigate advanced threats, compromised identities,and malicious insider actions directed at your organization. Azure ATP is available as part of the Enterprise Mobility + Security E5 suite (EMS E5) and as a standalone license.

### Understand Security Considerations for Application Lifecycle Management Solutions

The Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) introduces security and privacy considerations throughout all phases of the development process. It helps developers build highly secure software, address security compliance requirements, and reduce development costs. There are important security practices that should be followed:

* **Provide training**, as security is everyone's job.
* **Define security Requirements** including legal and industry requirements, internal standards and coding best practices.
* **Define metrics and compliance reporting** to ensure a minimum level of security quality.
* **Perform threat modeling** in environment with a meaningful security risk.
* **Emable design requirements** to help engineers implement more secure features.
* **Define and use cryptography standards** to ensure that all data is secure from unintended disclosure and alteration.
* **Manage security risks from using third-party components**, as they can be a possible vulnerability.
* Define a list of **Approved tools**.
* **Perform Static Analysis Security Testing** to test code before compilation.
* **Perform Dynamic Analysis Security Testing** to test the final packaged software.
* **Perform penetration testing** simulating the actions of a hacker.
* **Establish a standard incident response process** to address how to answer to new threats.

## Apply and monitor infrastructure standards with Azure Policy

<details>
<summary> 
Show content
</summary>
<p>

### Learning Objectives

* Apply policies to control and audit resource creation
* Learn how role-based security can fine-tune access to your resources
* Understand Microsoft's policies and privacy guarantees
* Learn how to monitor your resources

### Define IT compliance with Azure Policy

Your **policies** will enforce your rules for created resources, so your infrastructure stays compliant with your corporate standards, cost requirements, and service-level agreements (SLAs) you have with your customers.

**Azure Policy** is an Azure service you use to create, assign and, manage policies. This service evaluates resources looking for noncompliance with assigned policies.

> Azure Policies vs. RBAC: RBAC (role based access control) focuses on user actions at different scopes. Azure Policy focuses on resource properties during deployment and for already existing resources. It is a default-allow-and-explicit-deny system.

#### Creating a policy

To create a policy you need to

* Create a policy definition: it expresses what to evaluate and what action to take. For example, ensure all public websites are secured with HTTPS. A policy definition is represented as a JSON file. This can be done via Azure portal or Powershell.
* Assign a definition to a scope of resources. The policy will then need to be assigned to a resource orgroup of resources (with child inheritance). This can be done by using Azure portal, Powershell or Azure CLI.
* View policy evaulation results: it can allow a resource to be created even if it doesn't pass validation.

Then, in the Policy resource in the portal we can check for non compliant resources.

> OBS: Requests to create or update a resource through Azure Resource Manager are evaluated by Azure Policy first, evaluating all of them against each definition.

### Organize policy with initiatives

An initiative definition is a set or group of policy definitions to help track your compliance state for a larger goal. They are also assigned to a specific scope.

### Enterprise governance management

Access management occurs at the Azure subscription level. This allows an organization to configure each division of the company in a specific fashion based on their responsibilities and requirements.

Azure Management Groups are containers for managing access, policies, and compliance across multiple Azure subscriptions with child inheritance.

### Define standard resources with Azure Blueprints

**Azure Blueprints** enables cloud architects and central information technology groups to define a repeatable set of Azure resources that implements and adheres to an organization's standards, patterns, and requirements. It is adeclarative way to orchestrate the deployment of resource templates and artifacts.

It is based on defining "What should be deployed" and then keeping an audit of "what was deployed".

#### How is it different from Resource Manager templates?

The Azure Blueprints service is designed to help with environment setup. On the other hand, ARM templates are just a definition of resources that we may want to deploy that does not exist natively in Azure. Each blueprint can consist of zero or more ARM template artifacts.

#### How it's different from Azure Policy

A blueprint is a package of sets of standards, which can include policies in it. Policies are just used to audit and control resource usage.

### Explore your service compliance with Compliance Manager

Governing your own resources and how they are used is only part of the solution when using a cloud provider. You also have to understand how the provider manages the underlying resources you are building on. We have full transparency with four sources:

* **Microsoft Privacy Statement**: explains what personal data Microsoft processes, how Microsoft processes it, and for what purposes.
* **Microsoft Trust Center**: website resource containing information and details about how Microsoft implements and supports security, privacy, compliance, and transparency in all Microsoft cloud products and services. It includes information such as recommended resources, organizational roles and direct guidance, if needed.
* **Service Trust Portal**: hosts the Compliance Manager service, and is the Microsoft public site for publishing audit reports and other compliance-related information relevant to Microsoft’s cloud services. It helps your organization maintain track and compliance with standards such as ISO or GDPR, access Microsoft's audit reports, compliance guides and trust documents.
* **Compliance Manager**: dashboard that provides a summary of your data protection and compliance stature and recommendations for improvement.

### Monitor your service health

Azure provides two primary services to monitor the health of your apps and resources.

* **Azure Monitor**: helps you understand how your applications are performing and proactively identifies issues affecting them and the resources they depend on. It gets and analyzes data from your resources. Some of the data sources are Activity Logs of your applications, Event Logs, Application Insights, Azure monitor for containers or VMs... Moreover, it proactively notifies of critical conditions using **Alerts**. These can be configured based on metrics to have almost real-time responses. Also, Azure Monitor uses **Autoscale** to make sure that you always have enough resources to run your applications based on your rules and metrics. All of this information can be integrated with visualization tools.

* **Azure Service Health**: suite of experiences that provide personalized guidance and support when issues with Azure services affect you. It is composed of the following views:
    * Azure status provides a global view of the health state of Azure services.
    * Service Health gives a customizable dashboard that tracks the state of your Azure services in the regions where you use them.
    * Resource Health helps you diagnose and obtain support when a service issue affects your resources. It helps you understand if an SLA was violated.

### Principles of resource groups

A **resource group** is a logical container for resources deployed on Azure. All resources must be in a resource group and a resource can only be a member of a single resource group. Resource groups can't be nested.

They help to organize services, so we are interested in created *logical groups*. Moreover, deleting a RG will delete all services that it contains. They are also a scope for applying role-based access control (RBAC) permissions.

### Use resource groups for organization

It is important to apply naming conventions to both the RG and the contained services. We could organize resource groups by service, environment or authorization level, as they are a scope of RBAC. Furthemore, it may be useful organizing RG by life-cycle or billing.

### Use tagging to organize resources

Tags are name/value pairs of text data that you can apply to resources and resource groups. Tags allow you to associate custom details about your resource, in addition to the standard Azure properties a resource has:

* department (like finance, marketing, and more)
* environment (prod, test, dev),
* cost center
* life cycle and automation (like shutdown and startup of virtual machines).

Apart from organization utilities, tags could also be used to automate or schedule activies such as shutting down VMs. By adding the tag `shutdown:6PM` tag to a group of VMs, we could set up an activity that filters VMs by that.

### Use policies to enforce standards

For example, we could create policies that force the existance of a tag on a resource or restrict which types of VMs sizes can be deployed.

### Secure resources with role-based access control

Here are some best practices you should use when setting up resources.

* Segregate duties within your team and grant only the amount of access to users that they need to perform their jobs. Instead of giving everybody unrestricted permissions in your Azure subscription or resources, allow only specific actions at a particular scope.
* When planning your access control strategy, grant users the lowest privilege level that they need to do their work.
* Use Resource Locks to ensure critical resources aren't modified or deleted.

### Use resource locks to protect resources

Resource locks are a setting that can be applied to any resource to block modification or deletion. Resource locks can set to either Delete (all operations but delete are allowed) or Read-only (only allows read operations, blocking any modification).

<p>

### Learning Objectives

* Learn the different options you have to purchase Azure services
* Estimate costs with the Azure pricing calculator
* Predict and optimize costs with Azure Cost Management and Azure Advisor
* Apply best practices for saving on infrastructure costs
* Apply best practices for saving on licensing costs

### Purchase Azure products and services

There are three main customer types:

* **Enterprise**: Customers commit to spend a negotiated amount on services, usually paid annually. They also get customized pricings.
* **Web direct**: Customers pay general public prices and their monthly billing and payments occur through Azure website.
* **Cloud Solution Provider**: Microsoft partner companies that a customer hires to build solution on Azure. Payment and billing occur through the CSP.

#### Usage meters

Meters track the resource's usage used to calculate the bill. Usually they are compute hours, IP addresses, data transfer, Disk operations...

> OBS: De-allocating a VM is not the same as deleting a VM. De-allocation means the VM is not assigned to a CPU or network in a datacenter. However, your persistent disks remain, and the resource is present in your subscription. It's similar to turning off your physical computer.

### Factors affecting costs

There are different aspects which affect on the costs:

* **Resource type**, as costs are resource specific, so the usage meter varies. The usage that a meter tracks correlates to a number of billable units.
* **Services**: Rates and billings vary depending on the customer types.
* **Location**, based on the resource popularity, demand, and local infrastructure costs.
* **Azure Billing Zones**: Most of the inbound data transfers (data going into Azure datacenters) are free, but different charges will be applied on outbound data based on Billing Zones. A Zone is a geographical grouping of Azure Regions for billing purposes, for example Zone 1 is US, Europe, Canada, UK and France.

### Estimate costs with the Azure pricing calculator

Free web-based tool that allows you to input Azure services and modify properties and options of the services. It outputs the costs per service and total cost for the full estimate.

### Predict and optimize with Cost Management and Azure Advisor

Azure Advisor is a free service built into Azure that provides recommendations on high availability, security, performance, and cost. Advisor analyzes your deployed services and looks for ways to improve your environment across those four areas. 

* **Reduce costs by eliminating unprovisioned Azure ExpressRoute circuits**: Recommends deleting circuits not provisioned for more than 1 month.
* **Buy reserved instances to save money over pay-as-you-go**: This will review your virtual machine usage over the last 30 days and determine if you could save money in the future by purchasing reserved instances.
* **Right-size or shutdown underutilized virtual machines**: This monitors your virtual machine usage for 14 days and then identifies underutilized virtual machines.

#### Azure Cost Management

Azure Cost Management is another free, built-in Azure tool that can be used to gain greater insights into where your cloud money is going. You can get historical breakdowns, set budgets, schedule reports and analyze cost areas.

### Estimate the Total Cost of Ownership with the Azure TCO calculator

If you are starting to migrate to the cloud, a useful tool you can use to predict your cost savings is the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator. You'll need to define your workloads, such as the details of current servers and databases infrastructure, then adjust some assumptions on storage, hardware and network costs among others and finally view the report. The report allows to compare cloud vs. on-premises costs.

### Save on infrastructure costs

There are some ways in which customers can save on costs:

* **Azure Credits**, which can be obtained for specific subscription levels.
* **Use spending limits** prevent you from exhausting the credit on your account within each billing period. The spending limit feature is specific to subscriptions that include a monthly Azure credit allotment. It is not available on pay-only subscriptions.
* **Use reserved instances** purchased in one-year or three-year terms, with payment required for the full term up front.
* **Choose low-cost locations and regions**
* **Research available cost-saving offers**
* **Right-size underutilized virtual machines** by getting insights from Azure Cost Management and Azure Advisor.
* **Deallocate virtual machines in off hours**
* **Delete unused virtual machines**
* **Migrate to PaaS or SaaS services**, which provide substantial savings in both resources and operational costs.

### Save on licensing costs

* **Linux vs. Windows**: Costs can vary depending on the OS you use.
* **Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server**: letting customers repurpose their Windows licenses.
* **Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server**
* **Use Dev/Test subscription offers** to save cost on non-production environments.
* **Bring your own SQL Server license**
* **Use SQL Server Developer Edition**
* **Use constrained instance sizes for database workloads**
